Managing daily tasks efficiently is a significant challenge in today's fast-paced world, often leading to decreased productivity and unmet goals. Traditional to-do lists, while helpful, lack the engagement and motivation needed for consistent task completion. The To-Do List Manager project addresses these challenges by introducing a gamified approach to task management, helping users organize their tasks and incentivizing them to complete these tasks through a reward system. 
The primary issue this project addresses is the lack of user engagement and motivation in current task management systems. The central question is: "How can we enhance user productivity and task completion through an engaging and incentivised task management system?" The solution involves integrating a gamification strategy, rewarding users with tokens for completing tasks, which can be redeemed for various rewards.

Project Objectives
- The To-Do List Manager aims to:

- Enhance User Engagement: Use a reward system to keep users motivated.

- Improve Task Management: Provide an intuitive interface for task input, management, and tracking.

- Ensure a Seamless User Experience: Make the application easy to use and navigate.

- Maintain Security and Reliability: Store user data securely and ensure reliable application performance.
